# python_api_challenge

This assignment made use of Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to collect and analyze weather data to answer the question, "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" In addition, the geoViews Python library and the Geoapify API were used to apply the weather data and produce map visualizations in a vacation-planning exercise. All work was completed in a Jupyter notebook with a combination of starter code supplied and additional code developed thereafer. For the "WeatherPy" part of this assignment, a Python script was written to visualize the weather of more than 500 cities varying in distance from the equator. Several plots were created to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude, and for each, a linear regression was computed. For the "VacationPy" part of the assignment, a map was produced to display a point for every city from the corresponding data frame in WeatherPy and the humidity for that city. For cities with defined ideal weather conditions, a new data frame was constructed, and hotels for them identified.
